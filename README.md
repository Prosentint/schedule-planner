# schedule-planner

## Description

A work day schedule planner made using html, css, javascript, jquery, dayjs and making 
use of assets from font awesome and google fonts. The program will display the date in
the header of the page as the day of the week, month, day then year. On the main
content of the page a series of time blocks for the hours from 9 AM to 5 PM. Every 15
seconds the page checks the time and updates each time block based on if it has passed,
if it is the current hour, or if its in the future.


## Installation

GitHub Pages link: https://prosentint.github.io/schedule-planner/

## Usage

Each time block displayed in index.html contains a textbox and save button. You can write
tasks needed to be done during that hour or completed by that hour to keep track of a 
work day schedule. Clicking the save button on a time block will ensure that whatever is
currently displayed in the time block will be saved in local memory to be displayed even
on page refresh.
